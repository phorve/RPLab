This repository holds all work and code relating to work done in the Parthasarathy lab ([@rpLab](https://github.com/rplab)) at the University of Oregon. To date, this holds code and documentation for two major purposes:
1. Bacteria_in_Gels - Identification and quantification of bacteria in an agar matrix as visualized with a light sheet microscope

2. Imaris - Preparatory and supplemental scripts for the analysis of bacteria in an agar matrix suing [Imaris](https://imaris.oxinst.com/)
